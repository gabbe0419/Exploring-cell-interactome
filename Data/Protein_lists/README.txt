Lists of proteins in different interaction categories.
Made for testing and comparison of intrinsic disorder. 
Output of 'Intermediate.protein_grouping' executed in "disorder_plotting_output.ipynb"

'proteins_uniqueppi' = All proteins appearing in unique interactions
'proteins_sharedppi' = All proteins appearing in shared interactions
'proteins_common_sharedppi' = Proteins that exclusively appear in shared interactions 
'proteins_common_allppi' = Proteins that appear in both shared interactions as well as in unique interactions of both cell lines
'proteins_common_uniqueppi' = Proteins appearing in unique interactions of both cell lines 
'proteins_unique_uniqueppi_293T' = Proteins that exclusively appear in unique interactions of the cell line 293T 
'proteins_unique_uniqueppi_HCT116' = Proteins that exclusively appear in unique interactions of the cell line HCT116
